Q.  is JavaDcript Statically Typed or Dynamically Typed Language ?

Ans- JavaScript is a dynamically typed language.because you don't need 
     to specify the data type of a variable when you declare it. 
     The type of a variable is determined at runtime based on the value
     assigned to it. This allows for more flexible coding but can also 
     lead to type-related errors if not handled carefully. */

    let variable = 10; // variable is a number
    console.log(variable); // Output: 10

    variable = "Hello, world!"; // variable is now a string
    console.log(variable); // Output: Hello, world!

    // In this example, the variable variable starts as a number,
    // but it's later assigned a string value. JavaScript allows this 
    // change in data type without requiring explicit type declarations.
    // This demonstrates the dynamic typing nature of JavaScript.
